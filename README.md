##2. Game with unlimited shapes
In this we can add the shapes as much as we wish.

###Description
We can make any algorithm as we wish. In this game against computer the rule is<br> as follows.

###Rules
* Take the list of options (provided by the user or the default one).
* Find the option for which you want to know its relationships with other options.
* Take all the options that follow this chosen option in the list.
* Add to them the list of options that precede the chosen option.
* Now you have another list of options that doesn't include the "chosen" option <br>and has a different order of elements 
in it (first go the options following the <br>chosen one in the original list, after them are the ones that precede it).
* So, in this "new" list, the first half of the options will be defeating the "chosen" <br>option, and the second half will 
get beaten by it.
